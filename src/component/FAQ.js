  {
    question: "How do I search for movies?",
    answer: "Use the search bar at the top of the page to enter a movie title or keyword. You can also click on the tabs (e.g., Marvel, Funny) to filter movies by category."
  },
  {
    question: "What does the favorite icon do?",
    answer: "Clicking the heart icon on a movie card adds it to your favorites. The heart turns red when a movie is favorited, and grey when it is not."
  },
  {
    question: "Why are only 10 movies shown at first?",
    answer: "To improve performance and readability, we initially display 10 movies. Click the 'Show More' button to view additional movies, and 'Show Less' to revert to the initial 10."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I see more details about a movie?",
    answer: "Currently, the movie cards show the title, type, year, and rating. We're working on adding more details in future updates!"
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate are the movie ratings?",
    answer: "The ratings are sourced from the OMDB API, which pulls data from IMDb. They are generally accurate but may vary slightly depending on the source data."
